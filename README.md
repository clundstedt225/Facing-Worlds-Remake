# Facing-Worlds-Remake
A remake of the facing worlds map from unreal tournament 99 in the Unity game engine

This project was a creative exercise to learn more about enemy AI and behaviour trees. I chose to recreate one of my favorite FPS maps and emualate the team deathmatch game mode. For the design I went for a retro 3D game inspired asthetic.
